    <h1>My Dearest ❤️</h1>
    <p>
     From the moment I met you, something inside me shifted. Life hasn’t felt the same since — it’s as if you’ve brought a light into my world that I never knew I was missing. You make the
      simplest moments feel special, and the hardest days easier just by being you.
    </p>
    <p>
      I’ve come to realize that my happiness isn’t just about what I do or where I go, but about who I share it with — and I want that person to be you. Your smile, your kindness, your presence — they’ve become the things I look forward to the most.

This isn’t just a crush or a passing feeling. It’s deeper than that. I’ve thought about it carefully, and with every thought, my heart points to the same answer: you. You’ve become someone I can’t imagine my life without, and I don’t want to.

    </p>
    <p>So here I am, being completely honest with you — 
        I don’t just want to care for you from a distance,
         I want to be the one who stands by your side.</p>
    <p style="text-align:center; font-size:1.8rem; color:#b44b5a;">
      Will you be my girlfriend? <span class="heart">💌</span>
    </p>
    <div class="signature">
      Yours now and always,<br>
      Your heart's horizon❤️
